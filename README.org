* ArtiQ ECW
  This project has =NOTHING= to do with ArtiQ or the Sinara hardware.
  However it hosts the (sloppy) Arduino Nano C++ code (PlatformIO) I used for creating an /ArtiQ-crate/ like assembly for a
  mini-Game after the PhD defense of a (french) collegue.

  Behaviour:
  - System starts up with USSR anthem (the ArtiQ people had a tendency to name their devices after russian cities like Myrni, Urukul etc) from a Piezo-Speaker
  - The LED flashes in the russian-flag colors.
  - The PhD defendant has now to connect the individual sub-boxes to the "Kassler" (Kasli) box
  - Depending on how many are connected correctly, the Piezo-Beeper will make a noise. As closes he gets, the LED changes it's colors in the order of the french flag (and the piezo speaker noise gets shorter)
  - When all sub components are correctly connected, the french national anthem plays and the LED now shows the french flag colors in order.
